This project explores image colorisation using three Generative AI techniques—Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Autoencoders, and Diffusion Models—to compare their performance and output quality. The models are implemented in Python 3.7.9 due to compatibility requirements with TensorFlow and PyTorch. A virtual environment is created and configured using the provided requirements.txt file to ensure stable execution. The final system is deployed through a Streamlit web application, allowing users to upload grayscale images and visually compare the colorised outputs from each model in an intuitive interface. This project demonstrates the strengths and limitations of each generative approach while providing an accessible, interactive platform for real-time evaluation
